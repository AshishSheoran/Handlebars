# Web Development Assignment

I started this project with createing a server app that uses multiple routes which serve static  files(HTML & CSS).

In the second step, I added some more routes and functionality which will allow user to add new data into the application.

In the third step, we render our JSON data visually in the browser using handlebars.js views and layouts. Along with this, i added some more functions to allow user to update the data using a web form.

In the fourth step, I connected my server with the *PostgreSQL* on Heroku cloud platform and manipulated the data using it. Along with this, I used _pg_ and _sequelize_ modules in my data-service.js file. 

In the final step, I worked with client sessions and data persistence using MongoDB to add user registration and Login/Logout functionality and tracking. Moreover, I updated the password storage logic to include "hashed" passwords using bcrypt.js
